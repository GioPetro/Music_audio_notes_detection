# Music_audio_notes_detection
MAD|MR - Monophonic music Audio Detection for Midi Representation

This is my Bachelor Thesis, when studying Computer Science at the University of Piraeus.

It took place at 2017, under supervision of Professor, mentioned in the final [report](https://github.com/GioPetro/Music_audio_notes_detection/blob/main/My%20Thesis%20.pdf).

The attempt was to emulate this paper : https://arxiv.org/abs/1711.04480

Anyone is welcome to ask how this is done, comment and commit updated versions.
